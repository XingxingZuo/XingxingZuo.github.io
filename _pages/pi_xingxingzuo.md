## Prof. Xingxing Zuo

We conduct cutting-edge research on robust spatial intelligence for mobile robots to advance **open-world autonomy**.

Our long-term research vision is to enable natural interaction and seamless collaboration between robots and humans in open environments through precise understanding of robot states, surrounding 3D scenes, and action execution.
