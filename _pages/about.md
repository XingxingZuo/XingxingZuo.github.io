I'm a Postdoc Researcher at the School of Computation, Information and Technology, <a href="https://www.tum.de/en">Technical University of Munich</a>, Germany, working with [Prof. Stefan Leutenegger](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/leutenegger-stefan). Prior to this, I was an academic guest (2019 - 2021) in the [Computer Vision and Geometry Group](https://cvg.ethz.ch/) (CVG), at ETH  Zurich, Switzerland, working with [Prof. Marc Pollefeys](http://people.inf.ethz.ch/pomarc/). I was also a visiting scholar (2018) in the [Robot Perception and Navigation Group](http://sites.udel.edu/robot) (RPNG) of [Prof. Guoquan (Paul) Huang](https://udel.edu/~ghuang/) at University of Delaware, USA, and a visiting scholar (2017) in the [UTS Robotics Institute](https://www.uts.edu.au/research/robotics-institute), University of Technology Sydney, Australia, working with [Prof. Teresa Vidal Calleja](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Teresa.VidalCalleja).  I received my doctoral degree in 2021, from the Department of Control Science and Engineering at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), China, under the supervision of [Prof. Guoquan (Paul) Huang](https://udel.edu/~ghuang/) and [Prof. Yong liu](https://april.zju.edu.cn/team/dr-yong-liu/),  and graduated with honors. Previously, I graduated with honors and obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 2016.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
