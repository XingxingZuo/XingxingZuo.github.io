I'm an  Assistant Professor (tenure-track) in the Robotics Department at [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/). Prior to this, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Department of Computing + Mathematical Sciences, <a href="https://www.cms.caltech.edu/"> Caltech</a>. I also worked at Google in USA as a full-time visiting faculty researcher (Scientist) in 2023. I was an Postdoc Researcher (2021 - 2023) at  <a href="https://www.tum.de/en">Technical University of Munich</a>, Germany.  I was an academic guest (2019 - 2021) in the Department of Computer Science at ETH  Zurich, Switzerland. I was also a visiting scholar (2018) at University of Delaware, USA, and a visiting scholar (2017) at University of Technology Sydney, Australia. I received my doctoral degree in 2021 from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), China, and graduated with honors. Previously, I graduated with honors and obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 2016.

I am **hiring** highly motivated PhD students, research assistants, and visiting graduate students. Please check this [page](assets/pdf/hiring2025_En.pdf) (or [Chinese version](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/1890568428944867704)) for more details!

<h2>research interests</h2>
My research interests include Robotics, 3D computer vision, state estimation, and embodied AI.  

I'm conducting research on integrating the intelligence of the deep neural networks and the traditional probabilistic methods for real-time robotic perception tasks.
