I'm currently a Postdoc Researcher in [Smart Robotics Lab](https://mlr.in.tum.de) at the Department of Informatics, Technical University of Munich, working with [Prof. Stefan Leutenegger](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/leutenegger-stefan). Previously, I was an academic guest (2019 - 2021) in [Computer Vision and Geometry Group](https://cvg.ethz.ch/) (CVG), ETH, Zurich, Switzerland, working with [Prof. Marc Pollefeys](http://people.inf.ethz.ch/pomarc/). I was also a visiting scholar (2018)in the [Robot Perception and Navigation Group](http://sites.udel.edu/robot) (RPNG) of [Guoquan (Paul) Huang](https://udel.edu/~ghuang/) at University of Delaware, Newark, USA, and a visiting scholar (2017) in the [UTS Robotics Institute](https://www.uts.edu.au/research/robotics-institute), University of Technology Sydney, Australia, working with [Prof. Teresa Vidal Calleja](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Teresa.VidalCalleja). I got my doctoral degree from Department of Control Science and Engineering in [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), China, and graduated with honors in 2021. Before that, I graduated with honors and obtained my Bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 2016.


My research interests include robotic perception, 3D computer vision, probabilistic multi-sensor fusion, visual-inertial navigation, state estimation, and dense mapping.  I'm conducting researches on integrating the intelligence of deep neural networks and the traditional probabilistic methods for robot perception tasks.
